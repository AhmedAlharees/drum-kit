## Introduction

The Drum Kit Website is a fun and interactive project from Wes bos's JavaScript30 that lets you simulate playing drums by using your computer's keyboard(or touch screen). Each key on your keyboard corresponds to a different drum sound, allowing you to create your own beats and rhythms.

## Usage

1. Open the [Drum Kit Website](https:/ahmedalharees.github.io/drum-kit) in your web browser.
2. Use your computer keyboard to play the drums:
   - Press the corresponding keys (A, S, D, F, G, H, J, K, L) to play different drum sounds.
   - Each drum sound is associated with a specific key, and pressing the key will trigger the corresponding sound.
3. Get creative and experiment with different combinations to create your own music!
